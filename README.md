## Basics

When you are typing in your Terminal/Console, you are in a interactive `bash` shell 
(or its sophisticated cousins `zsh` or `fish`). 
Any command you type here, like `ls`, `whoami`, `echo "hello"` qualify as bash commands, 
and can be used in a script.

To create your first bash script, create a file `myscript.sh` and enter the following content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "You are $(whoami)"
```

## Variables

## Functions

## Arrays

## Maps

## Files and fil descriptors

## Flow control structures

## Error handling

## Creating and import packages

## Now you're a Gopher!
